# AlinaStrav-Practical_Project_Machine_Learning
My practical project when I studied artificial intelligence


Task: 
- Choose any dataset (can be found in kaggle, scikit inbuilt datasets, or find them anywhere on the internet, or even use generated - any source is acceptable. The only requirement for the generated datasets is that they must have noise >=0.3 in them)
- Choose a problem you want to solve. The problem must be a supervised learning problem - regression or classification.
- Use k-fold cross validation (CV) and/or GridSearch/RandomizedSearch tune a model/ensemble until you get best possible result and model selection.
- Include proof of the process of tunning and model selection (for example two cells where you tried some model parameters and another cell where you tried others). Expect questions: why certain parameters or parameter ranges were chosen.
- Visualize results - please be sure to visualize the final predictions: decision boundary (classific.) or the regression line (regr.) need to be added.
Provide a scoring metric - choose as appropriate (r2_score, f1 score, auROC and so on).
